# GenerativeDeepLearning

Repository for Documenting different generative learning approaches using the [Keras library and tutorials](https://keras.io/examples/generative/) for [synthetic data](https://www.amazon.com/Synthetic-Data-Machine-Learning-revolutionary-ebook/dp/B0BVMRHBNN).
The different type of models/generative algos that will be documented and explored will be publicly available and also primarily vision based (however that may change). Since I have already mostly documented [GANS](https://github.com/AdamClarkStandke/GAN_Models) I will primarily be focused on Diffusion Models, such as the following models: 

* Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models 
* Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
* Stable Diffusion
* Graph generation

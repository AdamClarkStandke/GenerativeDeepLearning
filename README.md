# GenerativeDeepLearning

Repository for Documenting different generative learning approaches using the [Keras library and tutorials](https://keras.io/examples/generative/) for [synthetic data](https://www.amazon.com/Synthetic-Data-Machine-Learning-revolutionary-ebook/dp/B0BVMRHBNN) and [Generative Deep Learning: Teaching Machines to Paint, Write, Compose, and Play](https://www.amazon.com/Generative-Deep-Learning-Teaching-Machines/dp/1492041947). The models that this repo will implement include the following: 

* [Generic Auto-Encoder](https://github.com/AdamClarkStandke/GenerativeDeepLearning/blob/main/AE.ipynb)
* [Variational Auto-Encoder](https://github.com/AdamClarkStandke/GenerativeDeepLearning/blob/main/VAE.ipynb)
* Autoregressive Models
  >*  [Text Generation using LSTMs](https://github.com/AdamClarkStandke/GenerativeDeepLearning/blob/main/AutoRegressiveModels_TextGeneration.ipynb)
  >*  [PixelCNN]()
